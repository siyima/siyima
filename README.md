## 👋 About Me

I am a recent Computer Science graduate with a strong interest in AI, full-stack development, and building impactful software products. My background as a competitive athlete has taught me the value of discipline, performance under pressure, and continuous improvement — qualities I bring into my engineering journey.

Currently, I am seeking entry-level or internship opportunities in software development, with a focus on back-end engineering, AI integration, or web technologies. I am based in Los Angeles and open to hybrid or in-office roles.

### 🧩 Logic Programming Picross Game

A logic-based implementation of the classic nonogram puzzle game **Picross**, built using Stanford's **Epilog logic engine** and JavaScript. The logic rules define win/loss conditions, mistake limits, and visual interactions using declarative constraints.

🧠 Features:
- Fully playable in-browser logic puzzle
- Dynamic cell-based grid with interactive constraints
- Assisted and hint modes via logical inferences
- Integrates HTML, JavaScript, and logic rules (Epilog DSL)

📄 Technologies: HTML, JavaScript, Epilog (logic programming), HRF

## 🌟 Strengths & Experience

- **Thrives Under Pressure**  
  My background as a competitive squash player taught me how to stay focused, adapt quickly, and deliver results — even when the pressure’s on. I bring that same energy to fast-paced team environments.

- **Real-World AI Applications**  
  I’m passionate about applying AI in ways that actually solve problems. Whether it’s auto-generating fashion product descriptions or building mock interview simulators, I care about building things people can use.

- **Always wanting to learn**
  I won’t pretend to know everything, but I’m curious, open to feedback, and not afraid to dive into something new.
